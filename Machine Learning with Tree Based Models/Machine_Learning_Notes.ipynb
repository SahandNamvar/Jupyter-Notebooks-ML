    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- ML is a subdomain of computer science that focuses on algorithms which help computers learn from data without explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI vs ML vs DS?\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence: is an area of computer science, where the goal is to enable computers and machines to perform human-like tasks and simulate human behavior.\n",
    "- Machine Learning: is a subset of AI that tries to solve a specific problem and make predictions using data.\n",
    "- Data Science: is a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data (which might use ML!)\n",

    "# Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. This means that each input comes with an associated output label, allowing the model to learn from these examples and make predictions about new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "Imagine you have three photos: one of a cat, one of a dog, and one of a lizard. These photos have labels 'cat', 'dog', and 'lizard'. The model learns to associate these images with their labels during training. So, when you provide new photos of cats, dogs, and lizards, the model can accurately label them based on what it learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Training Set:** The data used to train the model, which includes input-output pairs.\n",
    "- **Test Set:** The data used to evaluate the model's performance, which the model hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "- **Spam Detection:** Emails labeled as 'spam' or 'not spam' are used to train a model to filter incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to find patterns and relationships within the data without predefined labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Using the same scenario with photos of cats, dogs, and lizards, this time there are no labels for the photos. The computer examines the characteristics of each photo and groups them into clusters based on similarities it detects, such as color, shape, or texture. It might group all cat-like photos into one cluster, dog-like photos into another, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in the data while preserving important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior to target marketing efforts more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning involves an agent that interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties. The agent's goal is to learn a strategy, or policy, that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider training a dog to fetch a ball. The dog (agent) interacts with its environment (your commands, the ball, etc.). When the dog correctly fetches the ball, you reward it with a treat. If it doesn't fetch the ball, there is no reward or a mild penalty (like a firm \"No\"). Over time, the dog learns that fetching the ball results in rewards and will try to fetch the ball more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.\n",
    "- **Environment:** Everything the agent interacts with.\n",
    "- **Reward:** Feedback from the environment to evaluate actions.\n",
    "- **Policy:** A strategy that the agent follows to decide actions based on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "- **Game Playing:** Training a computer to play chess or Go by rewarding it for winning moves and penalizing it for losing moves.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Discrete Numbers\n",
    "- Discrete numbers are countable and often take on whole number values. They are distinct and separate, meaning there is no intermediate value between two consecutive numbers.\n",

    "Imagine three bins labeled [Hot Dog], [Pizza], and [Ice Cream]. We have three different types of categories or classes. Any new instance of a hot dog, pizza, or ice cream can be sorted into one of the three bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Classification:**\n",

    "# Supervised Learning Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of supervised learning is to train a model so that its predictions are as close as possible to the true values. By comparing the model's predictions against the actual values, we can improve the model's accuracy. Consider a CSV dataset file. Each row represents a single sample record or data point. The values within each record are called features. Hence, in the entire dataset, each column represents a feature of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Labels\n",
    "- **Features (X):** The input data used to make predictions. In the dataset, each row (data point) contains multiple features.\n",
    "- **Labels (y):** The actual output or target values that we aim to predict. These are the true values we compare our model's predictions against.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splitting the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a supervised learning model, we split our dataset into two main components:\n",
    "- **Feature Vector (X):** Contains all the dataset records and features (excluding the labels).\n",
    "- **Target Vector (y):** Contains the labels or the output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "If our dataset has the following columns: `Size`, `Bedrooms`, `Age`, `Price`\n",
    "- `X` would include: `Size`, `Bedrooms`, `Age`\n",
    "- `y` would include: `Price`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When we feed Vector X into the model, each row of the dataset (also known as a feature vector) is used to make a prediction. The model then compares its predicted outcome with the actual value from Vector y (the target variable). By doing this comparison, the model adjusts its parameters to improve its accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in Supervised Learning:\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Data:**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split the Data:**\n",
    "   - Further split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. (stratified sampling)\n",
    "   - Training set: Used to train the model.\n",
    "   - Testing set: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train the Model:**\n",
    "   - Feed the training data (X_train, y_train) into the model.\n",
    "   - The model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual labels (y_train) and adjusting its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate the Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the testing set (X_test, y_test) to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data."
